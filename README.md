# AI_Tictactoe
TicTacToe Game

This is a TicTacToe game developed in Java with two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI. The AI player utilizes the Alpha-Beta algorithm to make intelligent moves. The game also offers 3 difficulty levels

AI Algorithm
The AI player in this game utilizes the Alpha-Beta algorithm to make intelligent moves. This algorithm allows the AI to search through the game tree and evaluate different move possibilities to determine the best move.

To improve it make these changes to the following modes :
Easy: In this mode, the AI player makes random moves. It does not use the Alpha-Beta algorithm and simply selects a random available position on the board.
Medium: In this mode, the AI player combines random moves with the Alpha-Beta algorithm.
start by making a random move, and for the subsequent move, use the Alpha-Beta algorithm to search for the best move based on the current board state, repeat.
